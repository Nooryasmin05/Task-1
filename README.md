# Task-1
I tried to change the data using "Text to Columns", but due to some issues with my system, the data did not update.
I converted the "Age" column to numeric values.
I changed all the headers to lowercase.
I also removed all duplicate rows using Excel's built-in feature.
Additionally, I standardized text values such as gender, numbers, dates, etc.
